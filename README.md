# Nexpose_Tagging
Automatically tag assets by importing a file using API's - Python 

Description:
Apart from the many features offered by Nexpose/InsightVM, havent you at some point tried to perform a function that seems to take impossible amount of manual work? One of such problems is tagging your assets based on the owner. There might be thousands of assets with a different owner for every few assets. This code aims at resolving this problem by using the freely available API offered by Rapid7. 

Installation:
You would need the follwoing:
1. Nexpose console with details such as IP address, port number, GUI login credentials
2. Python
3. Postman (optional - will help with testing the API)
4. Download this code and run in python after changing the required information. 

I have used the API docuemntation from Rapid7 to build it and check for search criteria etc. If you want to change these, please refer to: https://help.rapid7.com/insightvm/en-us/api/index.html

I am open to all comments, changes, feedback or reccomendations, please do let me know if you have any ideas or additional use cases you would like some answers to.
